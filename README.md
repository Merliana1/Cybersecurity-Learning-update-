#  Cybersecurity Learning Update: Strengthening Security Posture

Today's lesson focused on understanding **security posture across the 8 domains of cybersecurity**, and emphasized the importance of **ethics** in ensuring we act with integrity to prevent fraud, abuse, or negligence.

##  Threats, Risks & Vulnerabilities

We explored the definitions and impact of:
- **Threats**: Potential cause of an unwanted incident
- **Risks**: Potential for loss or damage when a threat exploits a vulnerability
- **Vulnerabilities**: Weaknesses in a system that can be exploited

---

##  Key Frameworks Covered

-  **NIST RMF (Risk Management Framework)**  
  A 7-step lifecycle for managing risk:  
  `Prepare → Categorize → Select → Implement → Assess → Authorize → Monitor`

- **NIST CSF (Cybersecurity Framework)**  
  A 5-step continuous process for cyber resilience:  
  `Identify → Protect → Detect → Respond → Recover`

- **CIA Triad**  
  The core of security principles:  
  `Confidentiality`, `Integrity`, and `Availability`

---

##  Risk Management Strategies

We also learned the **four main risk response strategies**:
1. **Acceptance**
2. **Avoidance**
3. **Mitigation**
4. **Transference**

---

##  Security Controls

Three categories of controls to secure systems and data:

- **Administrative controls** – policies, procedures, training  
- **Technical controls** – firewalls, encryption, access controls  
- **Physical controls** – locks, guards, surveillance systems

---

##  OWASP Core Principles

Key secure design principles from the **Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)**:

- Minimize the attack surface  
- Defense in depth  
- Least privilege  
- Separation of duties  
- Simplicity in security  
- Fix issues correctly  

---

## Practical Takeaway

With this knowledge, I can now begin conducting **basic security audits** by applying:
- Risk frameworks (NIST RMF & CSF)
- The CIA Triad
- Risk strategies & security controls
- OWASP security principles
